## 🎯 Objectives
To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and build data-driven solutions for:

- **Classification Task:** Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment.  
- **Regression Task:** Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design.  
- **Unsupervised Task:** Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies.
